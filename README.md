*This repository contains the project submission for udacity.com project work "VirtualTourist" during my iOS developer certification program (course ND003).*

## App Description

„Virtual Tourist“ (VT) is an iOS 10.3 mobile app that allows users to pin any location on the map and automatically fetch corresponding photos of this location from the flickr.com api. The user can refresh the generated photo collection (fully or parts of it) anytime from inside the collectionView. The user can also delete existing locations from the map and take a look into stats like used space, amount of photos and locations.

## App Specifications

VT master (currently 1.0.0) was created using the latest XCode 8.3.3 (8E3004b) version and will be able to run under iOS version 9.n up to the latest iOS version 10.3.3. 

VT master is using POD composition technics to handle 3rd party dependencies. You have to install [POD](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) 
and run ```pod install``` before starting the app inside/as your xcode workspace.

VT uses one (1) APi endpoint (flickr.com:flickr.photos.search) by using iOS’ native http session handler abstraction.

VT uses 3rd Party Libraries for better UX/UI behavior and graphical elements from icons8. A complete list of used libraries and assets can be found inside the projects [COPYRIGHT.md](COPYRIGHT.md) file.

## App Features

VT uses some additional features. The app uses a dedicated process pipe for fetching api results and downloading media data from it. VT provides some basic statistics for used space and the number of photos/locations and helps users to reset previously set locations (including photos) with one click.

## App Structure

VirtualTourist is following the MVC pattern by structural and logical definition. The app is using dedicated view partials instead of base sub views of collection cells and annotations.

### MapView
*Each map point (pin) can be generated by a single longpress tap on any map location. After a user interaction(the tap) is confirmed, the download process of the corresponding photos will be started and run in the application background acompanied by a download progress bar. You can delete created pins anytime by clicking the unlock icon on the top right of application and afterwards tapping the pin you want to remove*
